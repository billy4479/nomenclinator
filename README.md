# Nomenclinator

A tool to get names for chemical compounds. Works just in Italian... for now ðŸ˜‰

This is meant to be used with `yarn` but you _should_ be able to use also `npm`.

## Build it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/billy4479/nomenclinator
cd nomenclinator

yarn

# To spin-up a dev server
yarn start

# To build for production
yarn build

# To run tests
yarn test

```
